Key insights
-Briarport sits in the upper-middle tier of livability among peer cities.

Intended audience
This dashboard is designed for:
-City planners
-Policy analysts
-Community stakeholders

It supports evidence-based decision-making by clearly linking data insights to actionable urban planning priorities.

Final takeaway
Briarport’s livability gains are real but fragile. Without coordinated investment in transit and sustainability, affordability and quality of life risks will continue to grow relative to peer cities.
