# 🏙️ Briarport Livability Dashboard (2015–2024)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **4-page interactive dashboard** analyzing livability trends in **Briarport** compared to **11 peer cities** over a 10-year period (2015–2024).
The goal is to move beyond descriptive metrics and deliver **actionable insights** for urban planning and policy decision-making.

The dashboard is designed with a **storytelling-first approach**, aligning data insights with how **city planners, policy analysts, and community stakeholders** think and act.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Compare Briarport’s performance against peer cities
* Identify strengths and gaps across key livability dimensions
* Reveal trade-offs between affordability, mobility, and sustainability
* Translate metrics into clear **planning priorities**

## 📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

The analysis focuses on **five core livability dimensions**:

* **Housing Affordability**
* **Transit Score**
* **Green Space (%)**
* **Emissions Index** (lower is better)
* **Livability Composite Score**

A composite livability index is derived to provide a holistic, comparable view across cities.
